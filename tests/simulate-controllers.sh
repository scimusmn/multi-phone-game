#!/bin/bash

# PLACEHOLDER

# Run this script to simulate many controllers connecting to game simultaneously

# This script would open multiple browsers (chrome, safari, and firefox) to "http://localhost:3000/?simulateInput" 

# At randomized intervals, this script could also close specific browser windows, and open others

# This would ideally create a good testing simulation of many visitors connecting and disconnecting

# Is there a way we could simulate the same thing, but using simulated mobile browsers?
